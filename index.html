        <p>Hello world! I'm Ernesto Garcia an animator from Tepic Nayarit that has been living in Monterrey for the past 8 years
        I graduted from a design school near la Huasteca called "CEDIM" about 3 years now, since then I've  been working on several projects
        from making animated traning videos for companies abroad to working on an animated movie here in San Pedro where I was the set supervisor, 
        I had to deliver the scenes to the lighting deparment in the final stage of modeling, I was also in charge of a group of modelers 
        who were in charge of replacing the low poly scenes with those of high poly, sadly the project ran out of money and I had to leave.</p>

        <p>Now I'm working as a community manager in a company here in Monterrey and also as a freelancer for another company doing some 3d modeling 
        and 3d motion graphics, and now that my schedule is a little loose I figured out that i have the time to learn something new, that is why im planning on learn the prestigious art of web development.</p>

        <p>So another chapter of my boring life starts here, sit tight cuz we are about to go on board on a challenging journey, stay tune and good night.</p>
